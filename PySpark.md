- It is a python library that enables large-scale data processing and analysing using Apache Spark.
- It allows you to work with big-data efficiently using many tools and funcitons for data manipulation, transformation and analysis

## Big-Data

- extremely large Datasets(structured & unstructured) 
- high velocity of data generation and processing
- with diverse data types
- requires distributed computing and parallel processing
- requires distribured storage systems (s3, hadoop)
- advanced analytics (AI, ML)
- requires specialised tools (Hadoop, Spark)
- deeper insights and complex desicion making
